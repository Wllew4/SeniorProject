# SeniorProject
My Senior Project for BHS. I will be writing my own language and then using it to complete the FizzBuzz challenge, and potentially to recreate John Conway's Game of Life.

Windows users can build using build.bat
Mac/Linux users can build using build.sh

Full releases to come at a later date.
